# 1. Business Problems

### Description
---
**Star Jeans** is a fictitious American enterprise whose business model is the sale of jeans by B2C ecommerce. Eduardo and Marcelo are Brazilian businessmen and decided to build a jeans company in the United States of America. The initial idea is the sale of jeans to men. 

**Purpose:** define the products to be sale and their best sale prices.

**Strategy:** keep operational cost and price the lowest as possible in the beginning and enhance them as long as more costumers are won. 

The partners hired a Data Science consultancy company to answer the following questions:

1. What is the best jeans sale price?
2. How many different types of jeans and colors should we choose?
3. What raw materials should we choose to make the jeans?
